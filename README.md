This project explores the "A Year of Pumpkins" dataset from Kaggle. The idea is to try out some regressions and proceed to a time series consideration. 
The datasets are from 13 different cities in the USA, for differing sizes and packaging of pumpkins for some months in 2016 and 2017.
A KNIME workflow is implemented for this experiment. Can be viewed by downloading the .knwf file and importing it into Knime.
Knime is a low code analytics platform, allowing for the implementation of data projects using workflows of linked nodes representing the pipeline.
See blog post for additional information (if you don't have Knime installed).
Other ideas to be explored to be added at a later stage.
